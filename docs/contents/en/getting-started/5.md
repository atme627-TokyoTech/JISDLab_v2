## 5. Getting static information
One of the functions of JISD is to provide static information about classes and methods.

First, static information is loaded by specifying the source directory and class directory, and then the user can access the static information.

Initialize the StaticInfoFactory class as shown below. The static information will be loaded and the `.jisd_static_data{number}` directory will be created under binDir. {number} is a sequential number starting from 0.



```java
var sif = new StaticInfoFactory(".", "../sample") // set srcDir and binDir
```

After this, for example, if you want to display the methods and fields contained in the jisd.demo.HelloWorld class, you can do the following


```java
ClassInfo ci = sif.createClass("jisd.demo.HelloWorld")
```


```java
ci.methodNames()
```


```java
ci.fieldNames()
```

Also, if you want to know the line where you can set an observation point to observe the local variable `a` in the `main` method of the class `jisd.demo.HelloWorld`, you can use


```java
MethodInfo mi = ci.method("main(java.lang.String[])");
LocalInfo li = mi.local("a");
li.canSet();
```

From this result, you can see that the user should place the observation points from line 26 to 32 of the `jisd.demo.HelloWorld`.

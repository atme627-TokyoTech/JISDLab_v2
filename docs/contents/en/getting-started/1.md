## 1. Create a Debugger instance
The `jisd.debug.Debugger` class provides four debugging methods:

1. Starts the program to be debugged as **internal** and debugs it using **JPDA** (Windows, Linux)

```java
Debugger(String main, String options)
```


2. Starts the program to be debugged **externally** and debugs it using **JPDA** (Windows, Linux)

```java
Debugger(String host, int port)
```


3. Starts the program to be debugged **internally** with **ProbeJ** added (Windows only)
  ```java
  Debugger(String main, String options, true)
  ```


4. Starts and debugs the program to be debugged externally** with **ProbeJ** added (Windows, Linux)

```java
Debugger(String host, int port, true)
````


The description of each argument is as follows.
- main: Class name with the main method.
  - Example: "jisd.demo.HelloWorld"
- options: Startup options for java command (e.g. classpath).
  - Example: "-cp sample"
- host: Hostname to connect to
  - Example: "127.0.0.1"
- port: Port name to connect to
  - Example: 8080

3. can be used only on Windows, while the other options support both Linux and Windows.  
However, 4. has the restriction that the OS on the program startup side is Windows only, but the OS on the debugging side supports both Linux and Windows.

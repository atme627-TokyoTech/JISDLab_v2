# Getting started
When debugging a Java application with JISDLab, the developer uses **JISD**, a debugging library for Java.

When debugging with JISD, you can start by creating a `jisd.debug.debugger` instance (→[1.](1.html)). You can also start by statically analyzing the information needed for debugging, such as the lines where observation points can be set (→[5.](5.html)).

The Jupyter Notebook versions of these tutorials are available at [debugspace/DebugTutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/tklab-group/JISDLab/blob/master/debugspace/DebugTutorial.ipynb]( DebugTutorial.ipynb), and you can run them in your environment.

The latest javadoc for JISD can be found at [https://sakupo.github.io/JISD-doc](https://sakupo.github.io/JISD-doc/).

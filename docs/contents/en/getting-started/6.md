## 6. Running external programs

There are two ways to execute an external program in JISD.  
One is to use `Utility.exec()`, which is a static method of JISD, and the other is to use `%exec` magic of IJava kernel.

Utility.exec()` returns an optional type of String[] containing stdout, stderr, and exit code, and the user can reuse the result.

- Using Utility.exec()

```java
exec("pwd")
```

- Using %exec magic


```java
%exec pwd
```
